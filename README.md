## 🌟 About the Project

This is an advanced Fake News Detection System that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify and classify fake news articles. The system is designed to help combat the spread of misinformation by providing accurate predictions about the authenticity of news articles.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time news article classification
- Advanced NLP preprocessing
- Multiple machine learning models
- User-friendly web interface
- Detailed prediction explanations
- Performance metrics visualization

## 📊 Technical Overview

### Architecture

The system consists of three main components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction
2. **Model Training**: Multiple ML models for classification
3. **Web Interface**: Flask-based web application

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
